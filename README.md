To-Do Web App
This is a simple, interactive to-do list web application built using HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript. It allows users to manage their daily tasks efficiently with a clean and modern user interface.

Features
Add Tasks: Easily add new tasks by typing into the input field and pressing "Add" or the Enter key.

Edit Tasks: Click on a task's text to edit its content. Press Enter or click away to save your changes.

Mark as Complete: Toggle the completion status of a task by clicking the check icon. Completed tasks are visually distinguished with a line-through and reduced opacity.

Set Due Date & Time: Assign a specific date and time to each task using the date and time input fields.

Drag-and-Drop Reordering: Rearrange your tasks by simply dragging and dropping them into a new order.

Persistent Storage: Your tasks are saved automatically to your browser's local storage, so they will be there even if you close and reopen the app.

Clear All: A "Clear All" button allows you to delete all tasks at once after a confirmation.

Technologies Used
HTML: Provides the structure and content of the web page.

CSS: Styles the application for a modern and user-friendly experience.

JavaScript: Handles all the dynamic and interactive functionality, including task management, local storage, and drag-and-drop.

Font Awesome: Used for the various icons (add, edit, delete, complete).

Files
The project is organized into three separate files for better code management:

index.html: The main file containing the page's structure.

style.css: Contains all the styling rules for the application.

script.js: Contains the core logic and functionality of the to-do app.
